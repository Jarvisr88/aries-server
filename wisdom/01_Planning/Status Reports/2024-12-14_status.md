# Status Report - December 14, 2024

## Overview
Significant progress made in implementing core business procedures for the Aries Enterprise system, focusing on billing, inventory, and order management functionalities.

## Completed Tasks

### Billing Procedures
1. **Invoice Processing**
   - `Invoice_AddSubmitted`: Handles insurance claim submissions
   - `InvoiceDetails_RecalculateInternals_Single`: Recalculates invoice totals
   - `InvoiceDetails_InternalAddSubmitted`: Creates internal submission transactions
   - `InvoiceDetails_InternalReflag`: Handles internal reflagging

2. **Billing Calculations**
   - `GetBillableAmount`: Calculates billable amounts based on rental types
   - `GetAmountMultiplier`: Calculates billing multipliers
   - `GetInvoiceModifier`: Determines billing modifiers for rentals

### Billing Domain
- Implemented `GetQuantityMultiplier` procedure
  - Calculates quantity multipliers based on sale/rental type
  - Handles all sale types and rental scenarios
  - Full test coverage with comprehensive test cases
  - Located in `app.procedures.billing.quantity_multiplier`

### Inventory Management
1. **Inventory Tracking**
   - `inventory_adjust_2`: Adjusts inventory quantities and costs
   - `inventory_refresh`: Updates inventory quantities
   - `inventory_order_refresh`: Refreshes inventory for orders
   - `inventory_po_refresh`: Refreshes inventory for purchase orders

2. **Serial Number Management**
   - `serial_order_refresh`: Manages serial reservations
   - `serial_refresh`: Updates serial number status

### Order Processing
1. **Order Management**
   - `order_process_2`: Processes orders and generates invoices
   - `order_update_dos`: Updates dates of service and quantities

### Customer Management
1. **Insurance Handling**
   - `mir_update_customer_insurance`: Updates MIR flags for customer insurance

## Recent Implementations

### Scheduling Domain
- Implemented `GetNextDosFrom` procedure
  - Pure calculation function for determining next DOS based on frequency
  - Full test coverage with comprehensive test cases
  - No external dependencies or database interactions
  - Located in `app.procedures.scheduling.next_dos`

## Implementation Details

### Code Organization
- Procedures organized by domain (billing, inventory, order, customer)
- Utility functions separated into reusable modules
- Consistent error handling and logging

### Key Features
1. **Billing System**
   - Multiple insurance level support
   - Complex rental calculations
   - Audit trail maintenance
   - Transaction history

2. **Inventory System**
   - Real-time quantity tracking
   - Purchase order integration
   - Serial number management
   - Warehouse management

3. **Order System**
   - Flexible DOS handling
   - Quantity conversions
   - Status tracking
   - Invoice generation

## Next Steps
1. **Implementation**
   - Continue implementing remaining procedures
   - Add comprehensive unit tests
   - Implement integration tests

2. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation
   - Create user guides
   - Document business rules

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Perform code reviews
   - Run security audits
   - Test edge cases

## Technical Debt
- Need to add more error handling
- Consider adding transaction rollback support
- Add performance monitoring
- Implement caching where appropriate

## Risks and Mitigations
1. **Risks**
   - Complex billing rules may lead to calculation errors
   - Data consistency across multiple procedures
   - Performance with large datasets

2. **Mitigations**
   - Comprehensive unit testing
   - Transaction management
   - Code review process
   - Performance testing

## Conclusion
The implementation is progressing well with core functionality in place. Focus remains on maintaining code quality while implementing remaining features.
