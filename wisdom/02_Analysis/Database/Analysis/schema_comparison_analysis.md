# Schema Comparison Analysis
Date: 2024-12-19

## Purpose
To analyze and document the differences between source and target database schemas to ensure complete data migration.

## Current Status
- Source Schema: Located in `/02_Analysis/Database/Schemas/source_schema.sql`
- Target Schema: Located in `/02_Analysis/Database/Schemas/target_schema.sql`
- Target Schema has 112 tables (confirmed from database view)
- Source Schema needs proper table count analysis

## Analysis Steps
1. Count total tables in source schema
2. Create complete table mapping document
3. Identify missing tables
4. Document table relationships and dependencies
5. Create migration plan

## Next Steps
1. Create a proper count of source schema tables
2. Document each table's purpose and relationships
3. Create mapping between source and target tables
4. Identify any data transformation needs

## Questions to Address
1. What is the exact count of tables in source schema?
2. Are there tables that have been merged in the target schema?
3. What are the dependencies between tables?
4. What is the optimal order for table migration?
