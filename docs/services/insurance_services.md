    """
```

#### Status Workflow
```
DRAFT -> SUBMITTED -> IN_PROCESS -> ADJUDICATED -> FINALIZED
                  -> REJECTED
                  -> PENDING_INFO
```

### InsuranceAuthorizationService

#### Purpose
Handles prior authorization requests and approval workflows.

#### Key Methods
```python
async def request_authorization(
    db: Session,
    auth_request: AuthorizationRequest,
    current_user: str

    """
    Submit authorization request.
    
    Flow:
    1. Validate policy and services
    2. Create authorization record
    3. Submit to external system
    4. Track authorization status
    5. Return authorization details
    """

async def check_authorization(
    db: Session,
    policy_id: int,
    service_type: str,
    service_date: Optional[date]
) -> Optional[AuthorizationResponse]:
    """
    Check if service is authorized.
    
    Flow:
    1. Find active authorizations
    2. Validate service type
    3. Check date range
    4. Return authorization if found
    """
```

#### Status Workflow
```
PENDING -> APPROVED -> ACTIVE -> COMPLETED
       -> DENIED
       -> CANCELLED
```

### InsuranceVerificationService

#### Purpose

## Error Handling

### Error Categories
1. Validation Errors
   - Invalid input data
   - Missing required fields
   - Date range errors

2. Business Logic Errors
   - Policy inactive
   - Service not covered
   - Authorization required

3. External Service Errors
   - Service unavailable
   - Timeout
   - Invalid response

### Error Handling Strategy
1. Use custom exceptions for business logic
2. Implement retry logic for external services
3. Log detailed error information
4. Return appropriate HTTP status codes
5. Provide meaningful error messages

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
1. Cache policy details
2. Cache benefit information
3. Cache verification results
4. Use Redis for distributed caching

### Database Optimization
1. Use appropriate indexes
2. Implement efficient queries
3. Use database connection pooling
4. Handle concurrent operations

### Async Operations
1. Use async/await for I/O operations
2. Implement background tasks
3. Handle long-running processes
4. Manage connection pools

## Security

### Authentication
1. JWT token validation
2. Role-based access control
3. API key management
4. Session handling

### Authorization
1. Resource-level permissions
2. Action-based permissions
3. Data access controls
4. Audit logging

## Monitoring

### Metrics
1. Response times
2. Error rates
3. Success rates
4. Resource usage

### Logging
